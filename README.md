# GetJoomla

![Banner](./banner.svg)

Fork of the getjoomla script of BestProject (https://github.com/bestproject/getjoomla.php)

This newer version contains:

* A fully refactored code,
* Require PHP 7.x or greater,
* More error messages to make debugging easier, 
* When the `joomla.zip` file already exists in the root folder, no zip will be downloaded again (principle of caching)
* ... 

This GetJoomla script has been written by BestProject (https://github.com/bestproject/getjoomla.php) and translated in French by [Yann Gomiero](https://github.com/YGomiero). Maintained during years by [Robert Gastaud](https://www.robertg-conseil.fr/) and refactored by [Christophe Avonture](https://github.com/cavo789)

## How to use

Just download a copy of the `src/index.php` file and save that file in the folder where you wish install Joomla. This done, start a browser tab and navigate to your folder; add `index.php` to the URL is needed.
